<hr> <h3>Industrial Experience</h3>
Lead Data Scientist: Bell Canada, Mississauga, Canada. October 2024 - till date
    <ul>
<li> Led the end-to-end development of a QA chatbot and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) bot using large language models (LLMs). The QA bot featured web search and mul-
timodal capabilities.</li>
<li> Designed, developed, and deployed agent-based solutions for RAG applications, orchestrated
Tool usage via custom MCP servers and ensured accurate grounding across data stores.</li>
<li> Engineered no-code and low-code solutions for RAG deployment pipelines using AgentBuilder
and AgentSpace - enabling rapid prototyping and accelerated rollout of production-grade AI
agents.</li>
<li> Built a custom RAG pipeline, including data ingestion, vectorization, and retrieval mecha-
nisms, to support intelligent information access.</li>
<li> Developed and implemented a conversational AI coach, leveraging LLMs to train customer-
service agents at Bell, resulting in a 20% reduction in onboarding time.</li>
</ul>
