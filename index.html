<b>Lead Data Scientist: Bell Canada, Mississauga, Canada. October 2024 - till date</b>
    <ul>
<li> Led the end-to-end development of a QA chatbot and a Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) bot using large language models (LLMs). The QA bot featured web search and multimodal capabilities.</li>
<li> Designed, developed, and deployed agent-based solutions for RAG applications, orchestrated
Tool usage via custom MCP servers and ensured accurate grounding across data stores.</li>
<li> Engineered no-code and low-code solutions for RAG deployment pipelines using AgentBuilder
and AgentSpace - enabling rapid prototyping and accelerated rollout of production-grade AI
agents.</li>
<li> Built a custom RAG pipeline, including data ingestion, vectorization, and retrieval mechanisms, 
    to support intelligent information access.</li>
<li> Developed and implemented a conversational AI coach, leveraging LLMs to train customer 
    service agents at Bell, resulting in a 20% reduction in onboarding time.</li>
</ul>

<b>Lead Data Scientist: 247.ai, Bangalore, India. September 2020 to June 2024</b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Demand Forecasting for E-commerce Inventory Planning:</b>
Developed a weekly demand forecasting solution to support inventory and supply planning 
        for an e-commerce retailer, delivering accurate 12-week product level demand projections 
        across regions. The model improved inventory balance by reducing excess stock while increasing 
        product availability during peak and promotional periods. The solution leveraged XGBoost using 
        historical sales, pricing, marketing, and temporal features to capture key demand drivers and seasonality effects.</li>
        <li><b>Named Entity Extraction (NER) from Document Images (Computer Vision and
NLP):</b> Extract the useful entities from the document images using OCR and graph convolutional 
            networks in supervised and unsupervised settings. It use both image and textual features. 
            This work got accepted to DAS-22 as an oral presentation. <a href="https://github.com/nagendarg/NER" target="_blank">[Code]</a></li>
    <li><b>Question and Answer Engine using RAG based LLMs (NLP):</b> The objective is to 
        design a question and answer engine using RAG based LLMs given the external knowledge corpus 
        in a cost efficient hybrid setting. The retrieval model is finetuned using the frozen LLMs
feedback. The retrieved documents are lengthy, spanning hundreds of words, which makes the
inference process more computationally expensive. We use compression techniques on the retrieved 
        documents to reduce this cost and improve accuracy. This involves creating summaries
and selecting only useful sentences from the retrieved documents.</li>
    <li><b>Sentiment Analysis (NLP):</b> This work involves extracting sentiment from visitor-agent
conversations using transformer based models. Sentiment is extracted at both the turn-level
and conversation-level. It is a sequence classification task with the goal of categorizing sentiment 
        as positive, neutral, or negative.</li>
    <li><b>Agent Co-Pilot using LLMs (NLP):</b> Utilizing Large language models (LLMs) to suggest
the most appropriate response for an agent based on a visitor’s utterance using retrieval augmented 
        generation (RAG) setup. We finetune LaMMA2 model on previous chat transcripts,
serving as an external knowledge base (corpus). The following best response is generated
through the trained LaMMA2 model.</li>
    <li><b>Agent Training using LLMs (NLP):</b> Agents are trained using LLMs, which effectively
act as customer in this context. LLMs use previous chat transcripts as an external knowledge
base. As agents are trained through LLMs, it offers cost-effective and efficient onboarding for
companies. This ultimately reduces the time and effort required for agent training.</li>
    <li><b>Smart Replay (NLP):</b> Retrieval based next best response suggestion in chatbot using transformers. 
        In this work, we use canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for comparing the query
token embeddings with the candidate token embeddings.</li> 
    <li><b>Fashion Recommender System — Virtual try-on (Computer Vision and NLP):</b>
The recommender system allows users to upload an image of a product and receive personalized 
        recommendations. Users can provide an image and a textual description of the desired
product. These recommendations can then be virtually tried before making a purchase using
virtual try-on techniques. This work involves a retrieval system, image classification, object
detection, segmentation and pose estimation.</li>
    <li><b>Agent Surveillance using the webcam (Computer Vision):</b> Agent activity is monitored 
        through the use of object detection and head pose estimation techniques. We use deep
learning models for these techniques. Object detection is utilized to identify the presence of
the agent, while head pose estimation is employed to determine their eye direction.</li>
    <li><b>Vehicle Damage Detection (Computer Vision):</b> Detecting and analyzing the damages
in vehicles like dent, scratch and glass broken using image classification, object detection and
semantic segmentation techniques. It provide valuable insights for insurance companies. For
retail clients, these models inspect product images for defects, ensuring high product quality.</li>
